Comparable API required compareTo API

compareTo method needs to follow
--> Totality/Total order

Other rules by convention
--> Returns a negative if this is less than that
              positive if this is greater than that
              zero if this is equal to that
--> Throws an exception for incompatible types

What os total order??
